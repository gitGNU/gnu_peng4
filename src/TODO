COMPATIBILITY
 * block encryption API (for things like TrueCrypt or dm-crypt)
 * maintain BSD compatibility; verify stdint.h (inttypes.h)
 * disable USE_XYZ compile time configuration

SECURITY
 * erase mtx from memory
 * unfold repetitions (according to classical block cipher scheme)

SECURITY (MINOR)
 * erase buffers after use
 * remove password from command line shown

OPTIMIZATION
 * offset initialization for thread's Mersenne Twister (when generating mtx)

LUXURY
 * binary tarball / rpm / deb
 * src subdir and more advanced fs hierarchy
 * exported API (libpeng)
 * progress in percent
 * compression?
 * shred original file (if desired)

DOCUMENTATION
 * doxygen

DEBUG
 * debug system (flags)
 * review MALLOC(), alloca()
 * get rid of abort()
 * get rid of option -m (multithreading)
 * get rid of testing defines
 * better Makefile concept (maybe cmake?) for generating flavoured bins
   without need to edit the Makefile
 * check -D, -R mechanism

TEST
 * automated test (write some tools and create a test parameter table)

PUBLIC
 * ask for code review
