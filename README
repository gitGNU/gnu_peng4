PENG4 ("Permutation Engine 4") is an implementation of an encryption algorithm 
based on long-distance bit permutations. It is still experimental. Written in C, 
it is suprisingly fast on modern computers. Lower performance is partially 
intended because of more difficult brute force attacks. The project was started 
in 1998, and in generation 4 the main objective was to avoid manual 
optimizations, since, surprisingly, bitpacking and access ordering have made 
things worse. The algorithm and the tool is intended for top secret material, 
albeit its implementation is experimental and may be faulty or too simplistic in 
some point of view. Caveat utilitor!
